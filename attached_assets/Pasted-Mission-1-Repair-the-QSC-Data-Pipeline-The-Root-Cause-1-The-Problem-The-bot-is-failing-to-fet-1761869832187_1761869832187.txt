Mission 1: Repair the QSC Data Pipeline (The Root Cause)
1. The Problem:
The bot is failing to fetch real-world data for the Dynamic QSC calculation. The logs clearly show that Position QS, Goal Diff QS, and Form QS are defaulting to a generic value of 50. This is "poisoning" the entire analytical funnel, causing all subsequent calculations (SoS, Weighted Metrics) to fail or produce zeroed-out results.
2. The Required Action (Your Repair Mandate):
Go to master_analyzer.py or wherever the functions for fetching league standings and team form are located.
Debug the get_standings function (or equivalent):
Log the exact API call being made to the /standings endpoint.
Verify that the league_id and season parameters are correct for the match being analyzed.
If the API call is failing, wrap it in a try/except block and log the specific error.
If the API call is succeeding but no data is returned, implement a fallback or log a clear warning.
Debug the Form Calculation Logic:
Verify the function that calculates a team's recent form (wins, draws, losses). Ensure it is correctly processing the last 5-10 match results.
The Goal: After your fix, when analyzing a game, the logs must show non-generic values for the QSC components. For example: Base QS: 85 | Position QS: 92 | Goal Diff QS: 78 | Form QS: 65. This will prove that the data pipeline has been repaired.
Mission 2: Repair the Tactical Tip Handling Logic (The Secondary Failure)
1. The Problem:
The logs show that high-confidence analyses without odds ("Tactical Tips") are being generated by specialist analyzers (e.g., cards_analyzer, shots_analyzer) but are then being incorrectly discarded by the global prioritization logic with the error ‚ö†Ô∏è Palpite ignorado (odd inv√°lida).
2. The Required Action (Your Repair Mandate):
Go to the global prioritization function (likely in master_analyzer.py or main.py) where all tips are collected and the best one is selected.
Implement a "Type Check": Before checking for a valid odd, you must check the type of the tip.
Create a Divergent Logic Path:
If tip['type'] == 'bet' (or similar): Proceed with the existing logic of checking for a valid odd, calculating value, etc.
**If tip['type'] == 'tactical': ** This tip must be completely exempt from any odd-related validation. It should be passed directly into the pool of "candidates for best tip" based solely on its confidence score.
The Goal: After your fix, Tactical Tips must never be discarded for having an invalid odd. They should be correctly collected and, if they have the highest confidence, become the AN√ÅLISE PRINCIPAL, or otherwise be listed under üß† SUGEST√ïES T√ÅTICAS in the final "Dossier" message.
Final Confirmation
Upon completion of these two missions, run a full analysis on any available game. The expected outcome is that the bot will no longer be silent. It will produce a complete "Analyst Dossier" because:
The QSC will be calculated with real data, allowing the entire analytical funnel to function.
The system will correctly handle and present all generated tips, including those without odds.
This is a repair mission. Execute with precision.
