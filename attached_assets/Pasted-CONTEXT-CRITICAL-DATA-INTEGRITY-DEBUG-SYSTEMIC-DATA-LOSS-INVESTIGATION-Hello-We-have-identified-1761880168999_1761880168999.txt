CONTEXT: CRITICAL DATA INTEGRITY DEBUG - SYSTEMIC DATA LOSS INVESTIGATION
Hello. We have identified a critical, system-wide issue. The application is failing to retrieve statistics for games across multiple leagues, including major ones like the Eredivisie. This strongly indicates a systemic bug in our data fetching logic, not an issue with data availability from the API provider.
Our Strategy: We will use a single, reliable Eredivisie fixture as a "perfect test case" or a "tracer bullet". Because we know this fixture must have data, any failure to retrieve it will expose the general bug in our data pipeline. The fix for this specific case should resolve the problem for all other leagues.
Your Mission: Perform a deep debugging trace on the analysis of a single, designated Eredivisie game. Your logging must be "super-verbose" to create a clear, step-by-step trail of the data-gathering process, allowing us to pinpoint the exact point of failure.
Required Action:
Select a Target Game: Hardcode a specific, upcoming Eredivisie fixture ID for this test. This fixture will serve as our "canary in the coal mine."
Implement "Super-Verbose" Logging in api_client.py:
Modify the primary function responsible for fetching a team's historical data (e.g., buscar_estatisticas_gerais_time).
This is a diagnostic task. The logs must be detailed enough for a human to follow the entire logical flow. Log the following steps in precise order: a. Log the Initial Call: LOG: "INITIATING HISTORICAL SEARCH for team_id [team_id] in season [season]." b. Log the Fixture List Call: Log the exact URL and parameters used to get the list of the last 5-10 fixtures for that team. c. Log the Fixture List Response: Log the number of fixtures returned and their IDs. LOG: "API returned [X] historical fixtures: [IDs...]." If zero, log this as a CRITICAL FAILURE POINT. d. Log the Start of the Statistics Loop: LOG: "STARTING detailed statistics loop for the [X] fixtures." e. Inside the loop (for each historical fixture ID): i. Log the Statistics Call: Log the exact URL and parameters for the /fixtures/statistics endpoint for each individual game. LOG: "Fetching stats for historical fixture_id [fixture_id]." ii. Log the RAW Statistics Response: Log the entire JSON response for that single game. This is crucial. iii. Log the Processing Outcome: LOG: "SUCCESSFULLY processed stats for fixture_id [fixture_id]." OR LOG: "FAILURE: No statistics found in API response for fixture_id [fixture_id]."
Run the Analysis:
Execute the analysis for your single, hardcoded Eredivisie game.
The Goal:
Your final output will be the complete, "super-verbose" log for this single analysis. This log is not just a stream of text; it is the evidence we will use to prosecute the bug. It must clearly show us which specific API call is failing or returning empty data, thereby revealing the flaw in our systemic logic. This is a data-gathering mission to find the root cause.
