Final System Audit & Post-Action Report
CONTEXT: PHOENIX PROJECT - FINAL AUDIT & POST-ACTION REPORT
Hello. The "Final Refinement & Hardening" directive has been executed. The next step is to verify the success of the operation.
Your mission is to once again act as a Senior Quality Assurance (QA) Architect. You must conduct a new, full system audit to assess the current state of the project after the latest changes. Your goal is to produce a final, updated "Project Health Report" that will serve as our definitive pre-launch checklist.
This is a final inspection and verification task.
Your Mandate: The Verification Protocol
You are to re-analyze every .py file in the project. Your primary objective is to verify that the four MAJOR WARNINGS from the previous audit have been successfully resolved. You will then re-evaluate the entire system and generate a new, updated report.
Your final report must follow the exact same structure as the previous audit for a clear before-and-after comparison.
The Required Output: The Final Project Health Report
Please generate your report using the following exact format. For each item, provide a brief, one-sentence explanation of your reasoning. Pay special attention to the status of the previously identified MAJOR WARNINGS.
PROJECT PHOENIX - FINAL HEALTH AUDIT REPORT (POST-ACTION)
ðŸ”´ CRITICAL ISSUES (System-Breaking Failures - Top Priority)
[ ] (Report any new or remaining critical issues that prevent the bot from functioning. Ideally, this section should be empty.)
ðŸŸ¡ MAJOR WARNINGS (High-Risk & Incomplete Features - High Priority)
[ ] (Re-evaluate the four previous major warnings: Tactical Tip Display, TODO/FIXME comments, Season Logic, and Cache TTL. Report if any of them are still not fully resolved. Ideally, this section should also be empty.)
ðŸŸ¢ STABLE & FUNCTIONAL (Components Working as Designed - No Action Needed)
[ ] Tactical Tip Display: Verify and confirm if the "@None" issue is resolved and the display is clean.
[ ] Codebase Cleanliness: Confirm if the TODO/FIXME comments have been significantly reduced or eliminated.
[ ] Dynamic Season Logic: Confirm if the season logic is now dynamic and no longer uses a fixed month-based rule.
[ ] Calibrated Cache System: Confirm if the cache now uses differentiated TTLs for odds, stats, and other data types.
[ ] (Re-list all other components from the previous audit that remain stable and functional).
ðŸ”µ OPPORTUNITIES FOR IMPROVEMENT (Minor Optimizations - Low Priority)
[ ] (Re-evaluate and update the list of minor, non-critical improvements. Some may have been fixed during the "TODO" cleanup. New ones may have been identified.)
âœ… SUMMARY
Overall System Status: Provide a final, one-paragraph summary of the project's health. State clearly whether the system is now considered "feature-complete" and ready for full operational testing.
Final Instruction: This report is our final green light. Be meticulous. Your assessment will determine if we move into the final testing phase or if further repairs are needed.
