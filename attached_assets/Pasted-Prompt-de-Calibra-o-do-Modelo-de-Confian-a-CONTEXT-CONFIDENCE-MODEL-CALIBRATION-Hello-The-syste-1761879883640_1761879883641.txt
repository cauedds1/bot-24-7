Prompt de Calibração do Modelo de Confiança
CONTEXT: CONFIDENCE MODEL CALIBRATION
Hello. The system is now architecturally stable and completing full analysis cycles without errors. However, it is currently generating zero valid tips, indicating that our confidence model is too restrictive.
The bot is functional but not useful. Our mission is to calibrate the confidence model to find a better balance between quality and quantity.
Your Mission: Investigate the confidence_calculator.py and the data flowing into it to understand why no tips are passing the threshold. Then, propose and implement adjustments.
Required Action:
Implement "Debug Mode" for Confidence:
Modify the dossier_formatter.py. Add a "debug mode" that, if enabled, will show not just the final confidence score, mas também a sua composição.
Example Debug Output: Confiança: 6.5/10 (Base: 7.0, Bônus Coerência: +1.0, Penalidade Risco: -1.5)
This will give us visibility into why a tip is receiving its score.
Analyze a "Failed" Game:
Run a full analysis on a single game in this new debug mode.
Observe the confidence scores for all potential tips (Over/Under, BTTS, Cantos, etc.).
Identify the primary reason for the low scores. Is the base_confidence too low? Are the penalties too high?
Propose and Implement Adjustments:
Based on your analysis, propose adjustments to the confidence_calculator.py. This might include:
Lowering the Minimum Threshold: Maybe a tip with 6.5/10 is acceptable to show as a "Sugestão Tática".
Reducing Penalties: Perhaps the incoherence penalty should be -1.5 instead of -2.5.
Increasing Base Confidence: Maybe the formulas that calculate the initial confidence are too conservative.
Implement the most logical adjustment.
The Goal: After this calibration, the bot should be able to generate a reasonable number of high-quality "Análises Principais" and "Sugestões Táticas" for a typical day of games, without becoming a "palpiteiro" que recomenda qualquer coisa. We need to find the sweet spot.
