Comprehensive System Audit & Focused Verification Protocol
CONTEXT: PHOENIX PROJECT - COMPREHENSIVE AUDIT & FOCUSED VERIFICATION
Hello. The "Critical Bug Fix" directive for the TypeError has been implemented. Before we proceed to the next major development cycle (UI/UX Feature Implementation), we must perform a full system audit to verify the fix and re-assess the overall health of the project.
Your mission is to act as a Senior Quality Assurance (QA) Architect. You must meticulously review the entire codebase and generate an updated "Project Health Report."
This is a final verification and reporting task. To guide your audit, a strategic focus guide is attached at the end of this directive. You must pay special attention to the files listed as "Maximum Attention".
Part 1: The Verification Mandate
You are to re-analyze the entire project. Your primary objective is to confirm that the TypeError is resolved and that the analytical funnel is now processing data correctly from start to finish. Your final report must follow the established "Project Health Report" structure for clarity and consistency.
Part 2: The Required Output (The Updated Project Health Report)
Please generate your report using the following exact format. For each item, provide a brief, one-sentence explanation of your reasoning.
PROJECT PHOENIX - HEALTH AUDIT REPORT (POST-TYPEERROR-FIX)
ðŸ”´ CRITICAL ISSUES (System-Breaking Failures - Top Priority)
[ ] TypeError in _calculate_moment_score: Verify if the goals_avg variable is now correctly converted to a float and if the TypeError is 100% resolved. Confirm if the bot can now complete a full analysis without crashing.
[ ] (Report any other critical, system-breaking issues you might find.)
ðŸŸ¡ MAJOR WARNINGS (High-Risk & Incomplete Features - High Priority)
[ ] QSC Data Integrity: Even though the TypeError is fixed, double-check that the inputs to the QSC calculation (Position QS, Goal Diff QS, Form QS) are consistently being calculated from real data and are no longer defaulting to 50.
[ ] Weighted Metrics Calculation: Confirm that with the QSC data now being correct, the Weighted Metrics are being calculated with non-zero values. The log should no longer show 0.0 cantos | 0.0 finalizaÃ§Ãµes (ponderado).
[ ] Tactical Tip Handling: Re-verify the status of this issue. Are "Tactical Tips" still being incorrectly discarded for having an invalid odd?
[ ] (Re-list any of the other warnings from the previous full audit that still apply, such as TODO comments, Season Logic, and Cache TTL).
ðŸŸ¢ STABLE & FUNCTIONAL (Components Working as Designed - No Action Needed)
[ ] Core Analytical Funnel: If the TypeError is fixed and the QSC/Weighted Metrics are now correct, confirm that the entire analytical funnel, from data fetching to final confidence calculation, is now end-to-end functional.
[ ] (Re-list all other components from the previous audits that remain stable and functional, such as the Database, API Client, VETO System, etc.)
ðŸ”µ OPPORTUNITIES FOR IMPROVEMENT (Minor Optimizations - Low Priority)
[ ] (Re-evaluate and update the list of minor, non-critical improvements. This list should remain consistent unless any points were incidentally fixed).
âœ… SUMMARY
Overall System Status: Provide a final summary. State clearly whether the critical crash bug is resolved and if the system's core analytical engine is now considered fully operational and ready for the next phase of feature development.
Part 3: Strategic Focus Guide (Investigation Priority)
To assist your audit, here is a breakdown of the system's files by their level of criticality. Your investigation must prioritize the "Maximum Attention" files, as they are central to the recent fixes and future features.
Level 1: Maximum Attention (The Heart of the Operation)
These files were recently modified (M) or added (A) and are crucial. Verify them with extreme rigor.
master_analyzer.py (M): The system's brain. Confirm the TypeError fix and the correct data flow for QSC and Weighted Metrics.
main.py (M): The system's orchestrator. Verify its interaction with other modules, especially the new job_queue.py.
job_queue.py (A): A new and high-risk component. Verify its ability to queue and process background analysis tasks.
Level 2: Important Attention (Critical Support Systems)
These files are vital to the process and deserve a confirmation check.
dossier_formatter.py: The bot's voice. Confirm it handles all analysis data correctly, especially Tactical Tips.
confidence_calculator.py: The final judge. Confirm it's receiving correct data and applying confidence modifiers properly.
knockout_analyzer.py: An incomplete feature. Verify its current state of robustness and integration.
Level 3: Routine Check (Likely OK)
These are specialist modules and infrastructure, likely stable but worth a quick review.
Specialist Analyzers (btts_analyzer.py, cards_analyzer.py, etc.): Their logic is simpler; confirm they receive data correctly from the master_analyzer.
Infrastructure (api_client.py, db_manager.py, config.py): These have been stable in past audits; a quick check is sufficient.
Final Instruction: Use this Strategic Focus Guide to direct your audit. Your final report should reflect a deep investigation into the Level 1 and Level 2 files. Be thorough.
